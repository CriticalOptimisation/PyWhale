## Python3 wrapper for whaleclub rest api

This repo contains a python3 wrapper for whaleclub rest api. It allows user to get mulptiple information and place live and turbo trades. For better user experience, I've paste/reformat whaleclub.co [api](http://docs.whaleclub.co/#list-turbo-positions) documentation for each function doc string. See usage section to see how it works.

This project was created on my own free time, so if you wish to support my work you could start by staring it and either:

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:logan169/PyWhale.git
    $ cd pywhale/app

## How to use it

After creating an account, get your API token from your API Settings panel which is available from the top right menu in your trading dashboard. You get one token for live trading and another for demo trading.

Then complet every following files with their respective api key:

- pywhale/app/BTC_demo_key.txt
- pywhale/app/BTC_live_key.txt
- pywhale/app/DASH_demo_key
- pywhale/app/DASH_live_key

#### Beware to not invert api key, I strongly advise that you verify twice that you've entered the right key in each file.

## Usage

    #Start ipython
    $ ipython3
    
    #Import module and create a PyWhale() instance
    $ from PyWhale import PyWhale
    $ pw = PyWhale()    
    
![Alt text](/pw.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")

    #Print help
    $ pw.help()
    
![Alt text](/help.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")
    
    #Get more information about a function
    $  print (pw.getBalance.__doc__)
    
![Alt text](/balance.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")
    
    #Remove print output function
    $ pw.verbose = False
    
    
### Default key

#### Pease note that if you don't pass a key parameter while calling a function, default.key 'BTC_demo_key' will be used.

    #Display actual default key that is going to be used (if key parameter is not specified)
    $ pw.default_key
    
    #Change default key 
    #Key parameter could either be 'BTC_live_key', 'BTC_demo_key', 'DASH_live_key' or 'DASH_demo_key'.
    $ pw.default_key = 'BTC_live_key'
